# Agricultural-Wage-Study

This project analyzes the relationship between agricultural wages, crop production, and climate indicators across U.S. counties. Using data from sources such as NASS, QCEW, and NOAA, we aim to explore labor elasticity, productivity, and climate impacts on rural economies.

## Objectives
- Collect and clean agricultural and wage data
- Merge climate variables (e.g., drought, precipitation)
- Perform spatial and temporal regression analyses
- Visualize relationships using geospatial tools

## Data Sources
- USDA NASS QuickStats API
- BLS QCEW (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages)
- NOAA Climate Data
- County shapefiles for geospatial alignment

## Requirements
See `pyproject.toml` for dependencies.

## Status
Project in early development. Data gathering and ETL scripts under construction.
